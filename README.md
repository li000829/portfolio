##Explain the following about your portfolio in an interview
###Tell us about your process (and different from figma)
    1.Completed this portfolio using html, css and bootstrap based on my assignment in UX design course.However, in the process of designing and completing the web page, the following changes were made in order to make the web page more smoothly used.
      1. When the four items of the navigation bar are in hover and active states, I used a yellow fill   color to replace the original yellow font color. This way it will look clearer when you click on the navigation bar.
      2.In the Projects page, it was originally designed under the desktop module to display 4 pictures in a row at the same time. However, according to the actual page width, if 4 pictures are arranged in a row at the same time, the pictures will be too small, which is smaller than the iPad module and mobile module. Therefore, change the layout of the pictures to the same row of 2 pictures as the ipad module.
      3.According to the convenience of using accessible, aria tag, alt tag, etc. are added, and the contrast of the page is adjusted.

###challenges you faced during development and how you overcame those changes
    In the process of web development, I really did encounter difficulties in changing the settings of homepage under mobile sytle. I have been unable to achieve the design effect I want with HTML and CSS. Eventually I took the time to figure out how to do it using javascript and Bootstrap. 

###What have you learned by creating your web portfolio?
    By completing the portfolio assignment, I became more familiar with the functions of bootstrap. This is indeed a good thing to learn and use. In addition, I also have more knowledge about using html to build web pages. Of course, the use of accessibie is also very important and worthy of me learning more.
